# Data Scientist Portfolio

This repository contains data science projects and corresponding source code. They were all created as part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python Certification. The majority of the analysis was conducted using Keras, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.
